            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a MSCA Ph.D candidate at the Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence (SCAI). I belong to a mixed research
                unit named STMS, which stands for <i>Science and Technology of Music and Sound</i>. My office is located
                on the <i>Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique-Musique</i>
                (<a href="https://www.ircam.fr/">IRCAM</a>), next to the Centre Pompidou.</p>
            <p>
                The goal of my thesis is to generate realistic sounds with controllable pitch, timbre and expresiveness.
                To tackle this problem, classical methods (concatenative synthesis, physical modeling, signal-based methods,...) as well as
                deep learning end-to-end methods (WaveNet, DDSP,...) are found in literature. The hypothesis of my thesis
                is that incorporating physics-priors into deep learning methods reduces the space
                of possible solutions and provides interpretable parameters. In particular, the implemented methodology
                to learn the physical constraints is the Port-Hamiltonian formulation, developed around energy balance
                and passivity. </p>
            <p>
                Starting my second year of
                the thesis, I would love to dedicate my working life to machine learning research and its different applications.
                My biggest passions are music, cinema and languages.
                </p>
                where I carry out my research on physics-structured neural networks for musical instrument synthesis
                After having studied my Bachelor's in both Mathematics and Physics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid
                (UCM), I came to Paris to do a master's degree in Statistical Learning and Deep Learning at the
                Sorbonne Université (<a href="https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/offre-de-formation/masters/master-mathematiques-et-applications/m2-parcours-5">M2A Mathématiques et Applications: Apprentisage
                    et Algorithmes</a>), where I fell in love with artificial intelligence. </p>
             <p>You can download my CV <a href="path/to/your/cv.pdf" download>here</a>. All my research is co-funded by
             the European Union as part of the <a href="https://soundai.sorbonne-universite.fr/">SOUND.AI</a> program. </p>
